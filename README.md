My name is Izabela Olszewska. I would like to take my first steps in  IT. I would like to join your team. I don't have commercial experince. 
I know a lot of  tools and I have technical skills. I know  the difference between functional and non-functional testing , 
white-box and black-box testing and know what regression testing is.  
 
Highly motivated individual with experience in sales and customer service. I work in a very organized and 
systematic way so as not to make mistakes, which is very important in IT, where one small mistake can cost a lot of time and money. 
In addition, I am reliable.  You can be sure that I will do every task well, which is very important when not  working under constant supervision. 
But most importantly, I am very innovative. I love to create and improve new procedures and applications. In my current company, 
I report bugs and  suggest improvements in the application. I am  willing  to present myself at an interview.
